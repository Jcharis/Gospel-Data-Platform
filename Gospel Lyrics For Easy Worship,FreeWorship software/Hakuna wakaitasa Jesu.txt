Hakuna wakaitasa Jesu
Hakuna wakufanana Yesu
Hakuu hakuna

There is No one, None like Jesus
There is No one, no one like Jesus
Their no one like Him

There is No one, None like Jesus
There is No one, no one like Jesus
Their no one like Him

Somebody praise the Lord Now
I will praise Him everyday 
Everyday I will praise the Lord

Papa I praise your Name
You are worthy of My praise
Papa I praise your Name 
You are worthy of My Praise

You are worthy of My praise
You are worthy of my praise
Lord Almighty I will praise your Name

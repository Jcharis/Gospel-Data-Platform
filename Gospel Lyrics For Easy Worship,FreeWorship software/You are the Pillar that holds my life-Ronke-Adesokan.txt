You are the Pillar that holds my life
You are the Pillar that holds my life
Master Jesus; You are the pillar that holds my life
You are the Pillar that holds my life

I think of what I’ve been through, through the fire and the storm
So many times I’ve felt like I would never make it through
But for your Grace, mercy and power; God you saw me through
Now look at what the Lord has done; You are my pillar

You know my beginning, You know my ending
Lord I am safe and secure in your arms Jesus, Jesus
Oh You are the Alpha and Omega
You are the Alpha and Omega
Where would I be without You?

You are the Pillar that holds my life
You are the Pillar that holds my life
Master Jesus; You are the pillar that holds my life
You are the Pillar that holds my life

I am alive and well because of You God
Through the triumphs, through the pains, God You kept me
How can I ever praise You enough?
You are the reason I live and rule
Bless Your Name, Bless Your Name, Bless Your Name
Can somebody testify and sing

You are the Pillar that holds my life
You are the Pillar that holds my life
Master Jesus; You are the pillar that holds my life
You are the Pillar that holds my life

A very present help in times of trouble
Oh God my help in ages past, my hope for years to come
The Mighty fortress is my God
What a Bread of Life Jesus, all my troubles and burdens He carries
Ever Faithful, ever sure

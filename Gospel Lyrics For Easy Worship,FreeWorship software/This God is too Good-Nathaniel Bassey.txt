I know a God, who's merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious
I'm the apple of his eyes
The thought that fills his heart
Every Morning, noon and night
He loved me when I didn't care
And was patient till I came
Running back into his arms
Look how he turned my life around
Made me a shining star
His glory to reveal

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because
This God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because
This God is too good oh

Don't look too far to see
How good he is, just look at me
He took me from the miry clay
Set my foot upon the rock
I'm standing in his righteousness
He took away my sin and shame
Gave me a brand new name
His beloved and the redeemed
Look how he turned my life around
Made me a shining light
His glory to reveal

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because
This God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because
This God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because
This God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because
This God is too good oh

Jesus you're too good oh
Jesus you're too much oh
His grace is too much oh
His love is so deep oh

I don't deserve you
(I don't deserve you)
But I am grateful
(Always)
I don't deserve it
(No no)
But you love me anyway
So I worship you forever
Love you forever
This God is too good oh

Look what you've done for me
See how you set me free
How you washed me in your precious blood Jesus

Love Him forever because

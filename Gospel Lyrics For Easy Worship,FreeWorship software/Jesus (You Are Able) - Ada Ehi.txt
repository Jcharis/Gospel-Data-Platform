What can’t you do, Jesus!
Creator of the universe, what can’t you change
What can’t you do, Jesus
Name above every other name, what can’t you change
What can’t you change, Jesus (repeat)

Refrain:
You are able, Great and Mighty God
You are able, Jesus
There is nothing,
Nothing you cannot do
Nothing you cannot change
Nothing you cannot turn around
You are able, Great and Mighty God
I put my trust in You
You are able, Jesus

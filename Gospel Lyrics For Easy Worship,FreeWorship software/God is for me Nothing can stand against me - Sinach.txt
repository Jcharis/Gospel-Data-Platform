God is for me Nothing can stand against me
God is for me I will not be moved

I am a burning and shinning light
The salt of the earth
I am new man I'm glorified
I'm an ambassador

God is for me Nothing can stand against me
God is for me I will not be moved

Everything about me is blessed
The head not the tail
I'm the righteousness of God in Christ
Sin has no power over me

God is for me Nothing can stand against me
God is for me I will not be moved

No weapon fashioned against me
Shall ever prosper
I have a Godly heritage
Great things are spoken of me

God is for me Nothing can stand against me
God is for me I will not be moved

Ah ah ah ah ah God is for me,
Complete in Him, Complete in Him
Complete in Him, I belong to Jesus

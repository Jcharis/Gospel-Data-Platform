When I think upon your goodness;
And Your faithfulness each day
I’m convinced it’s not because I am worthy
to receive the kind of love that You give.
But I’m grateful for your mercy,
and I’m grateful for your grace
And because of how You’ve poured out Yourself,
I have come to sing this song out in praise

Imela, Imela
Okaka, Onyekeruwa
Imela, Imela,
Eze m Oh
(Thank You Jesus)

Who am I to sing Your praises?
Who am I to worship You?
It’s Your blood that makes the difference in me
And made a way to enter into Your throne
I could not come near Your presence
I could never sing Your song
But the sacrifice on Calvary’s tree
is the reason I can cry out today

Imela, Imela
Okaka, Onyekeruwa
Imela, Imela,
Eze m Oh

Onyedikagi? Ekene diri gi
Onyene mema
Onyedikagi? Ekene diri gi
Onye nagworia

Imela means thank you

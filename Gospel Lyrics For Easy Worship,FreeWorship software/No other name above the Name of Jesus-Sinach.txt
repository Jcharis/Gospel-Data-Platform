No other name above the Name of Jesus
Yesterday, today, forever Jesus

There’s no other Name like Yours
In heaven, earth, beneath the earth
Every knee should bow to the
Name of Jesus, Jesus

No other Name that heals all pain, Jesus
No other Name gives peace of mind, Jesus
No other Name that breaks strongholds, Jesus
No other Name that gives me joy, Jesus!

There’s no other Name like Yours
In heaven, earth, beneath the earth
Every knee should bow to the
Name of Jesus, Jesus

We worship You
O precious Jesus, You are the Great I AM
Precious Jesus, You are the Morning Star
Precious Jesus, You are the Prince of Peace
Precious Jesus, You are my everything

There’s no other Name like Yours
In heaven, earth, beneath the earth
Every knee should bow to the
Name of Jesus, Jesus

Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus.

I have no other God but You
I have no other God but You
I have no other God but You
I have no other God but You

You have done what no man has done
You will do what no man can do
You have done what no man has done
You will do what no man can do

I have no other God but You
I have no other God but You
For You have done what no man has done
And You will do what no man can do

I have no other God but You
I have no other God but You
You have done what no man has done
You will do what no man can do

Spoken "
I may not know what you are going through today
The sorrow, the hardship, the pain
But though the mountains crumble and the oceans rage
And war against my soul the devil may wage
Though the tempest has turned my smile upside down
And my life like a river of sorrow in which I drown
Yet will I stand
Unshaken, for as long as it lasts
Faithful is He that promised and it shall come to pass
If God be for us
Then who can stand against
The God who spoke all the earth into form
He said let there be light
Let it be bright
Let there be day
Let there be night
Out of the sound of His voice
Birds, fish and trees did come
The mountains they melt like wax
The hills skip like young cows
At the sound of the voice of the God that we serve
Our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Besides Thee oh Lord,
We have no other God "

I have no other God but You
I have no other God but You
You have done what no man has done
You will do what no man can do

You have done what no man has done
You will do what no man can do
You will do what no man can do
You will do what no man can do

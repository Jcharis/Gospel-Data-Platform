Only You can do what no man can do
Only You can say what no man can say
Only You can change any situation at all
Only You are able, Daddy
Only you are cabable, Jehovah
(Repeat)

Refrain: You are doing the same today
Just You walked the streets of Galilee
And like you healed the sick and raised the dead
Like You saved Lazarus; comfort, comfort
You are doing the same today x2
Oh God my promoter, Jesus my promoter
Opening every door, Fighting all my battles
Healing the broken heartache
You are doing the same today

(Refrain)

Refrain: Jesus!
Say He is capable
The Resurrection, and the life
Jesus, Jesus!
The Son Of God, the Word of God
Jesus only You can, make the blind to see
Jesus only You can, make the lame to walk again
Jesus only You can, make the dead to rise up
Jesus my promoter; Jesus!
